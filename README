K-Means algorithm for Neural Networks course on 8th semester.

The dataset (data.plants) is provided by UCI's machine learning repository. link : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/plants
Now, we do some pre processing before applying k-means on the dataset, and then we get our metrics (Sihouette metric, and Daviesâ€“Bouldin index metric)
The pre-process we do is to order the states as columns, then parse the plants.data and set 1's where the state
exists, and 0's if doesn't exist.
